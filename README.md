# Unity3D Specular Fake

This repository provides two shaders to face a specularity effect from a non-existing directional light. Useful for low-performance environments or other special effects. 

The demo scene contains three objects with the effect. 

* A transparent torus
* A transparent and rough cube
* A solid torus
